Hello and welcome

Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to construct a simple two (or
more, should you choose) page application.

The application shall accept the details of a person looking for a share
house/apartment. On submit, write the details to permanent storage
to be read later; and display a simple confirmation page.

You are free to split the page into any subset of details you want.

The amount of details granularity is completely upto you, as is the
language(s)/application(s) you choose to do this application in.

Expectations:

1. Application should be simple, as stand alone as possible and extremely easy to
   deploy/run on any machine.
2. Input validation on the client and server side.
3. Some form of styling on all pages of the application.
4. Quality Assurance on the application.

Submission:
As you can see, we have sent you a git repository. Please email us
back the link to a github repo with the solution. We are looking to
evaluate your engineering skills across the stack (from input to storage),
even if the stack does not have all the features in it. So we recommend taking
the Agile approach to this problem :)

Best of luck
